## 🌍 Live Demo
🔗 **Deployed on Vercel:** [https://weather-agent-phi.vercel.app](https://weather-agent-phi.vercel.app)

---

## 🧠 Approach & Design Decisions
* **Modular Architecture:** Built a component-based structure to ensure code reusability and scalability.
* **Streaming Logic:** Implemented efficient stream handling to display responses as they arrive from the API.
* **User Experience:** Prioritized a familiar "AI Chat" design language to make the app intuitive.
* **Early Deployment:** Pushed to Vercel early in the development cycle to ensure production-ready code.

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations
* **Authentication:** No user login system (single-user session).
* **API Reliance:** Backend API availability directly affects weather responses.
* **Theme Support:** Dark mode is currently limited in some UI sections.

---

## 📦 Deliverables
* Complete runnable source code.
* Live deployed application link.
* Clean and readable component structure.
* Fully responsive UI design.

---

## 🎥 Optional Enhancements (Roadmap)
- [ ] Dark / Light theme toggle.
- [ ] Export chat history (PDF/JSON).
- [ ] Full user authentication system.
- [ ] Progressive Web App (PWA) support.
- [ ] Unit tests and accessibility improvements.
